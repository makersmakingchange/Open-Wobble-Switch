# Custom Toppers for the Open Wobble Switch

One of the unique features of the Open Wobble Switch is the ability to swap the toppers and create custom toppers. To make the process of creating a custom topper as easy as possible, we've included some additional files and instructions.

The switch has an M12-1.75 x 7mm length external thread to interface with the topper.
