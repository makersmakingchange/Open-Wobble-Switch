# Open-Wobble-Switch
The Open Wobble Switch is a cost effective, open source assistive switch similar to commercially available Wobble Switches. The switch is activated by applying force to and moving a wand in any direction. The switch can be activated by various body parts including the limbs and head. It provides a momentary closed contact that can be used to activate various assistive devices.

The switch requires approximately 0.55 N (55 gf) and about 24 mm of travel to operate, though this will vary a bit depending on the topper attached. The Open Wobble Switch has an interchangeable topper that can be swapped for different shapes and sizes

## Getting Started

### 1. Order the Off-The-Shelf Components

The [Bill of Materials](/Documentation/Open_Wobble_Switch_BOM.xlsx) lists all of the parts and components required to build the Open Wobble Switch. The main switch component needs to be ordered online. The rest of the off-the-shelf components are also online or may be available in smaller quantities at your local hardware store or dollar store.


### 2. Print the 3D Printable components

Print the components for the switch and one or more toppers.

A single Open Wobble Switch will requires the following:

- 1X [OWS_Set.stl](/Build_Files/3D_Printing/OWS_Set.stl)


All of the files and individual print files can be in the [/Build_Files/3D_Printing_Files](/Build_Files/3D_Printing/) folder.

### 3. Assemble the Switch and Toppers

Reference the [assembly instructions]((/Documentation/Open_Wobble_Switch_Instructions_v1.0.pdf) for the tools and steps required to build each portion.
