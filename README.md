# Open-Wobble-Switch
The Open Wobble Switch is a cost effective, open source assistive switch similar to commercially available Wobble Switches. The switch is activated by applying force to and moving a wand in any direction. The switch can be activated by various body parts including the limbs and head. It provides a momentary closed contact that can be used to activate various assistive devices.
